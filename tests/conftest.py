"""Shared pytest fixtures/setup for the spotisub test suite.

Importing anything under the `spotisub` package for real (as opposed to
re-implementing its logic under test) means importing spotisub/__init__.py,
which unconditionally builds the whole Flask app, registers routes.py, and
transitively imports spotisub.generator -> spotisub.helpers.spotipy_helper /
subsonic_helper -> several third-party packages (flask_bootstrap,
flask_restx, flask_apscheduler, flask_socketio, pygtail, spotdl) that have
nothing to do with the matching/persistence logic under test here
(specs/archive/reliable-track-matching.md). Those packages are either
unmaintained/hard to install against a modern Python, or (spotdl) pull in a
heavy yt-dlp dependency chain purely because
spotisub.helpers.subsonic_helper imports spotisub.helpers.spotdl_helper
unconditionally, which in turn constructs a real Spotdl client at import
time regardless of whether SPOTDL_ENABLED is set.

To keep this suite runnable without installing that unrelated stack, and
without touching any real network service, tests/_stubs/ provides minimal
stand-ins for exactly those modules (see each stub file for what it's for
and why it's safe to fake). Everything this spec actually touches --
spotisub.database, spotisub.classes, spotisub.constants, spotisub.utils,
spotisub.helpers.subsonic_helper -- is imported and exercised for real; only
their unrelated import-time dependencies are faked out.
